title: Marine Life Friendly Boat Propulsion System
description:  For this project, I designed and simulated a kinematic linkage system that converts rotary input from an electric motor into biologically inspired propulsion, with the goal of reducing harm to marine life such as manatees. Traditional boat propellers present significant risks to wildlife, causing injuries and fatalities. This project addressed that challenge by developing an alternative propulsion mechanism that delivers effective thrust in shallow waters without exposed rotating blades.
