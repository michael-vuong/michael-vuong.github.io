# 4 Bar Mechanism 
My first tutorial assembling and analysing the motion of a 4 bar mechanism
### Embeed images

## Tracing the velocities in the x and y direction
### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="x velocity.png" height="400" %}
### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="y velocity.png" height="400" %}

## Maximum value of the motor torque: 604.08 N*mm
### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images=".png" height="400" %}

## Angle of the crank at maximum motor torque: -33.60 degrees

## Maximum vertical force exerted on Bearing and NewBearing: 12N, 10N

## The minimum motor power required to move the crank at constant angular speed of 600 rpm: 496.5W

## Explain the meaning of the negative motor torque values and their relation to the motion of the mechanism links: The negative motor torque values mean that the motor is opposing the motion of the mechanism links.
