# 4 Bar Mechanism 
My first tutorial assembling and analysing the motion of a 4 bar mechanism
{% include image-gallery.html images="/assets/images/4-bar.jpg" height="200" %}

## Tracing the velocities in the x and y direction
{% include image-gallery.html images="x-velocity.jpg" height="400" %}
{% include image-gallery.html images="y-velocity.jpg" height="400" %}

## Maximum value of the motor torque: 
604.08 N*mm
{% include image-gallery.html images="max-torque.jpg" height="400" %}

## Angle of the crank at maximum motor torque:
-33.60 degrees
{% include image-gallery.html images="angle-displacement.jpg" height="400" %}

## Maximum vertical force exerted on Bearing and NewBearing:
12N, 10N
{% include image-gallery.html images="bearing-vertical-force.jpg" height="400" %}

## The minimum motor power required to move the crank at constant angular speed of 600 rpm: 
496.5W
{% include image-gallery.html images="motor-power.jpg" height="400" %}

## Explain the meaning of the negative motor torque values and their relation to the motion of the mechanism links: 
The negative motor torque values mean that the motor is opposing the motion of the mechanism links.
